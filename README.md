# NFLBigData

This repo contains my machine learning project from an undergraduate Data Mining class. Using R and the nflfastR package, I developed predictive models to analyze NFL data. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. While the final writeup is not included, visualizations and key results are provided.
