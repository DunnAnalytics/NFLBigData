# NFLBigData

This repo contains my machine learning project from an undergraduate Data Mining class. Using R and the nflfastR package, I developed predictive models to predict whether NFL plays would be a run or a pass. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. While the final write-up is not included, visualizations and key results are provided.
