# NFLBigData

This repository is the result of a machine learning project from my undergraduate Data Mining class. I was given free rein to build predictive models in R using NFL data from the nflfastR package. Some data cleaning was required. The main purpose of this project was to apply machine learning concepts to real-world data and generate a report to present our results. I have omitted the final writeup from the repo but have included some of the visualizations and results.
